\beginsection How To Type Tamil

Because all the ingredients where available and easily adaptable to
Malayalam-\TeX, I decided to add the capability to typeset Tamil. The
font used is {\tt wntml10}, available free from Washington State
University. All you have to do to be able to type Tamil is say

\medskip
{\tt\bslash input tmlmacs}
\medskip

somewhere near the beginning of your document. Then you can enter
{\it Tamil-mode} with {\tt<{}tm>} and leave it with {\tt<{}/tm>}.

The following table shows the character(s) you have to type to produce
a Tamil character.

\bigskip
\input tmltrans

When you use Tamil in your document, you have to run it once more
through a pre-processor, to replace the transcription for \TeX-commands
that typeset the Tamil characters. Say

\medskip
{\tt patc -p tm2tex.pat {\it input-file output-file}}
\medskip
to pre-process Tamil.

If you
have lots of text available in another transcription, you can convert
it with {\tt patc} to this transcription. two pattern-files are
provided. {\tt adami2tm.pat} translates the ADAMI transcription scheme,
and {\tt wntml2tm.pat} translates the original transcription used
at W.S.U.
