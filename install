--------------------------------

Malayalam-TeX has been installed and tested on MS-DOS with emTeX,
Atari-ST with CSTeX, OxTeX on Macintosh and with TeX on various UNIX
machines. 

The installation procedures differs on all these machines, so
look under the heading of your machine.

Included are .PK files intended for use with a CanonCX laser
printer engine (which is the engine most 300 DPI laser printers
use) If you need different fonts, you will have to generate the
fonts yourself using METAFONT.

Atari-ST with CSTeX (assuming you use the command line shell gulam)

To install:
  1. Unpack the archive. Tools to uncompress gzip files and unpack tar archives
     on The Atari-ST are available at most ftp servers.
  2. Place the *.tfm files in a directory where TeX can find them (depending
     on your configuration, that might be C:\cstex\tfm\)
  3. Place the *.pk files in a directory font300\ where the DVI previewer and DVI
     printer driver can find them. (possibly C:\cstex\fonts\font300\)
  4. Place the mm.ttp, patc.ttp and the gulam batch files (ending with .G)
     in a directory your shell can find them (normally C:\bin\)
  5. Set the environment variable MMDIR to the path where mm.trs, mm.scr, etc. are.
     (mmfont\preproc in the distribution)
     Everything should be in working order now
To create the .pk fonts:
  1. Start C_MF
  2. Edit the file MM.FTS to include the fonts and magnifications you need
  3. Set the input directory to the directory where the Malayalam Metafont sources are
  4. Select the output device
  5. Create the fonts. (This may take some time)
     C_MF will automatically place the resulting .PK files in the correct directories.


MS-DOS with emTeX

To install:
  1. Unpack the archive. Tools to uncompress gzip files and unpack tar archives
     on MS-DOS are available at most ftp servers.
  2. Place the *.TFM files in a directory where TeX can find them
  3. Place the *.PK files in the directories where the DVI previewer and DVI printer
     driver can find them.
  4. Place the PATCH.EXE, MM.EXE and the batch files (ending with .BAT)
     in a directory your path points at (normally C:\DOS\)
  5. Set the environment variable MMDIR to the path where MM.TRS, MM.SCR, etc. are.
     (MMFONT\PREPROC in the distribution)
     Everything should be in working order now
To create the *.PK fonts:
  1. Edit the file MM.JOB to select the files and device you need
  2. Run MFJOB with this file.

Macintosh

TODO, not that the preprocessor and patc utility are simple ports of the
UNIX style tools, and use a commandline. Sorry mac fans!

UNIX

To install:
  1. Unpack the archive.
  2. Place the *.tfm files in a directory where TeX can find them. (or tell
     TeX where they are by setting the environment variable TEXFONTS)
  3. Place the *.pk fonts in a directory your previewer and printer driver can
     find them. (or tell TeX where they are by setting the environment variable
     TEXPKS) For some TeX implementations, it may be required to rename the
     fonts from *.pk to *.300pk
  6. Look in mm.c to find the line saying #define ATARI_ST, change this into
     #define UNIX
  5. Make the preprocessor and the patc program, by saying make in the directory
     they reside. (You will have to change the compiler and and include paths in
     the Makefile to reflect your setup)
  6. Make the batch programs (ending in .g) executable, if you wish you may remove
     the .g extension. (It is only needed for gulam on the Atari)
  7. Set the environment variable MMDIR to point at the directory where
     the .scr and .trs files are  (mmfont/preproc in the distribution).
To create the *.*pk fonts:
  1. run Metafont, for example to make mm10.300gf
     type `mf &plain "\mode=hplaser; mag:=1; input mm10"'
     replace hplaser with your favourite mode
  2. Convert the resulting *.*gf file to a *.*pk file
     type `gftopk mm10.gf mm10.pk'
  To make all fonts, run the batch file mm.bat. This may take some time.
To test
    type `ml mmtable.mm mmtable.tex'
    type `tex &plain mmtable'
    Print or view the resulting mmtable.dvi file.


Porting

The included source code has been successfully compiled on

* Turbo-C v2.03 for Atari ST.
* gcc v2.3.1 on HP-UX.
* Turbo C++ on MS-DOS. (use Huge memory model and word alignment options, increase
  stack-size)

If it doesn't work right away, things you may need to do include:
* change options in the Makefile
* make a project file for Turbo C++ (the one included is for Atari, and will NOT
  work with Turbo C on MS-DOS or Windows!)
* change the line with
    #define ATARI_ST
  in the file mm.c to your system type.

Please notify me if you port this to any system, especially Macintosh.

Good luck
