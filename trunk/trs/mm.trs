% This .TRS file defines the transcription used in the input text.
% It translates (sequences of) ASCII-characters (patterns) 
% into the internal codes of the pre-processor.
% You should never change the (UNICODE derived) codes of the letters,
% but you can redefine the transcription if you take care that the
% table does not define a pattern twice, or that it is ambigious
% otherwise.
