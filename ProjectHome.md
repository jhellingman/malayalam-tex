Malayalam metafont, TeX macros and preprocessor to typeset the Malayalam script, as used in the state of Kerala, India.

Most of this metafont was produced in the period 1993 to 1994. Some final edits have been made in 1999. I've now uploaded the entire source under the GPL 3.0. This implementation can handle both the (complex) traditional as the modern variants of the Malayalam script.
